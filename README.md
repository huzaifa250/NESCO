Current Technical Challenge :

I suppose if we face credentials problem on the exsisting payment mentod or ex we want to add
a new provider which does not provided by odoo also the loading traffic may increase which can affect on system.
Solution : 
- I'm testing avialbe provider some are work well also we can add extranal provider by using 
odoo JSON/RPC Api or extranl API such as REST API.
- I can Implement or configure odoo with Nginx.Whcih could work as reverse proxy,caching,load balancing.
